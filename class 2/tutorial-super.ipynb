It is OK if you only memorize that ````super```` can be used as a way to inherit the basic attributes of another class. You usually will just copy other people's code with ````super in it, and won't have to think about it too much. However, it is important you appreciate what ````super```` does as it comes up a lot when using Pytorch.*"
